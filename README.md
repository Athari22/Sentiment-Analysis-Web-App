# Sentiment-Analysis-Web-App
In this project, I created a Sentiment Analysis Web App using PyTorch and SageMaker. This project is part of the [deep learning nanodegree program at udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).    

# Project Overview
In this project, I constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. Used Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, created a simple web app that will interact with the deployed model.
